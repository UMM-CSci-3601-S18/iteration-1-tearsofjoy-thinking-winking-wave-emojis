                        3 Tips for Better Health Care
                    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                    Good health care happens through a partnership between you and your health-care provider. Here are some tips on how you can work with your providers to get the best health care.
                    <br/>

                       <br/>

                    <u>1.Take part in your health care.</u>
                    <br/>
                    >Tell each provider about what health care you have had and who has provided it.<br/>
                    >Let them know about any other treatments you have tried that were not prescribed by a doctor, such as herbal treatments, home remedies or acupuncture.<br/>
                    >Tell your providers about any cultural and spiritual needs you may have.<br/>
                    >To be sure you understand health-care instructions, repeat them to a family member or friend.<br/>
                    >Let any provider know if you are not sure about any part of your care. If you think something might not be safe, tell your providers right away.<br/>


                       <br/>

                    <u>2.Bring a family member or friend with you to be your partner in care.</u>
                    <br/>
                    >Pick someone who will speak up for you and help get things done for you.<br/>
                    >Show your partner in care where to find your medical records at home. Let them know what medicines you take and where they are located.<br/>
                    >Plan for your partner in care to stay with you during exams, treatments and in the hospital.<br/>
                    >Itâ€™s OK for your partner in care to ask questions and take notes.<br/>


                       <br/>

                    <u>3.Know about your medicines.</u>
                    <br/>
                    >Ask your provider what a new medicine is for and how it will help you.<br/>
                    >Have the brand names and any other names for the medicine written down for you.<br/>
                    >Find out how to take the medicine and for how long.<br/>
                    >Ask the pharmacist for written information about what to watch for when you take the medicine.<br/>
